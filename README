This is my attempt to create a simple WriteRoom/DarkRoom like environment in Vim. 

It is probably not ready for prime-time yet. 

It will almost certainly interact badly with any other plugins/scripts that hack buffers as it uses two hidden buffers to get the column feel of DarkRoom.

You will want to ":set wrap lbr" for it to work most effectively.
You will want to maximize vim before calling ":colorscheme darkroom" for it to look reasonable.
You will also need to use :qa to exit (or :q several times in succession)
